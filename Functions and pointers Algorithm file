Goal:
To input the names and grades of two students.
To validate the grades (check if any are negative).
To sort the grades in ascending order.
To print the sorted grades or display an error if invalid grades are detected.

Input(s):
Names of Students: Two strings, firstStudentName and secondStudentName.
Grades of the First Student: An integer array arr1 with a maximum size defined by ARR1_MAX.
Grades of the Second Student: An integer array arr2 with a maximum size defined by ARR2_MAX.

Output(s):
Sorted Grades or Error Message: For each student, either their sorted grades or an error message if any grade is negative.

Steps:
Prompt for Input: Request the names and grades for two students.
The program mistakenly requests the first student's name twice due to a typo.
Input Validation: Check each array of grades to ensure there are no negative values.
If negative grades are found, set a flag indicating invalid input.
Sorting: If the grades are valid, sort them in ascending order using the sort function. This function uses a basic bubble sort algorithm and a customSwap function to reorder the elements.
Output: Print the sorted grades for each student. If invalid grades (negative numbers) are detected, print an error message instead.

Notes:
The program has a bug in the getInput function, where firstStudentName and secondStudentName are each read twice instead of reading the name and then the grades.
The array sizes ARR1_MAX and ARR2_MAX are constants, determining the number of grades to be input for each student.
The containsNegative function is used to check for negative grades.
Sorting is done using the sort function, which implements a bubble sort algorithm.
The customSwap function is used by the sort function to swap elements.
The final output is produced by the print function, which either prints the sorted grades or an error message based on the validation results.
